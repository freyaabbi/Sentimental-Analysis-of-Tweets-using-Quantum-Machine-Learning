# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Tweets-using-Quantum-Machine-Learning

This code implements a quantum-based sentiment analysis system for tweets using Qiskit. Here's a brief overview:

1. The system uses quantum feature mapping to encode preprocessed tweet text into a quantum state
2. It leverages the ZZFeatureMap from Qiskit for quantum encoding
3. Text preprocessing includes tokenization and stopword removal
4. The sentiment is analyzed using quantum measurements and converted to a score between -1 and 1

Key features:
- Quantum circuit with configurable number of qubits
- TF-IDF vectorization for text features
- NLTK-based text preprocessing
- Quantum measurement-based sentiment scoring
